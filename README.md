<h1> Working with embeddings:
<h2> An introductory workshop with applications on Semantic Search
</div>
    
In this repository, you'll find code and resources needed for this workshop. Whether you're attending in person any of the sessions or exploring independently on your own at home, the materials are designed to help you grasp the fundamentals of embeddings in their use for Natural Language Processing, specially in the case of Semantic Search.  

We will cover the following topics:

> - Text normalization
> - Statistic methods like Bag of Words and TF-IDF
> - Static embeddings from models like Word2Vec or GloVe
> - Contextual embeddings from models like BERT or SentenceTransformers
> - Indexing of embeddings with FAISS

The workshop is designed to be as practical as possible. All the necessary theoretical background that could be needed has been covered in a comprehensive course, available online for your convenience. You can find the video here:
