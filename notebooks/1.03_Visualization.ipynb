The dataset consists of a training set with 60,000 examples and a test set with 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image of a handwritten digit (0 through 9), and the images are accompanied by corresponding labels indicating the actual digit they represent.

    "\n",
    "PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique and works by identifying the principal components (eigenvectors) that capture the most significant variance in the word embedding space. By selecting a subset of these components, it reduces the dimensionality of the word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is computationally efficient, making it suitable for large datasets and facilitating quicker analyses. Additionally, it provides a linear transformation that maximizes variance, thereby preserving the overall structure of the data. This quality makes PCA particularly effective in capturing the primary sources of variation in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, PCA comes with its set of limitations. Notably, it assumes linearity, making it less suitable for datasets with complex, non-linear relationships. Moreover, PCA prioritizes global structures, potentially overlooking intricate local patterns within the data. This lack of sensitivity to local relationships can be a drawback when trying to reveal finer details or clusters in the dataset.\n",
