The interpretation is such that the smaller the distance, the \"closer\" or more similar the vectors or points are in Euclidean space. Conversely, a larger distance indicates greater dissimilarity or \"distance\" between the vectors or points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculating the euclidean distance we will use the <kbd>norm</kbd> function from the <kbd>linalg</kbd> module in Numpy. That function returns the norm of a vector, so for calculating the distance between two vectors we just need to substract them and find the norm of the new vector."
